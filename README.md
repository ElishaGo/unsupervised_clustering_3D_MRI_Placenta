# Unsupervised_clustering_3D_MRI_Placenta
Analysis of placenta can lead to early diagnosis of pregnancy complications. The collected data is 3D MRI scans of placenta from healthy women and women with Gestational Diabetes women scanned in Bruker Biospec 15.2-T MRI scanner. In order to characterize the disease and healthy scans we performed unsupervised clustering analysis, using Kmeans and Fuzzy C means.
